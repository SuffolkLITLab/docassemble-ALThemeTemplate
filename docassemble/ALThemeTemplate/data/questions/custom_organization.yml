  Use this file as a model for your own organization's branding package. You can
  also place custom versions of questions from ql_baseline.yml into this file.

  Then, reference this package in your own interview YAML file. For example,
  if you added this file to a package named "ALMyState", you might have 
  an include block in each interview that looks like this:
    ---
    include:
      - docassemble.ALMyState:custom_organization.yml

########################### Bootstrap theme ##############################
comment: |
  If you would like to customize:
  - button style
  - fonts
  - theme colors

  You should generate a bootstrap theme file instead of overriding individual
  CSS properties.

  Instructions available here:
  https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/customization/overview/

  Once you generate the theme file: 
  
  1. name it something like "my_theme.css"
  2. Upload it to the "static" folder
  3. add a block like this:
  ---
  features:
    bootstrap theme: my_theme.css

  The al_courts.py file in this package is a simple frontend to an Excel spreadsheet
  with court names and addresses.

  You may want to edit the Python code to add additional features, such as address
  lookup, or to move the spreadsheet into the database for performance reasons.

  - .al_courts

  For some cases, you can choose your court.
  % if user_role=='plaintiff':    
  How do you know which court to choose?
  
  The District Court and Superior Court are all courts that can hear
  any type of case. Housing, Probate and Family and Juvenile Court are
    **specialist** courts that hear one kind of case.
  They have judges with special training as well as special 
  resources available.
  
  Different courts can make different kinds of decisions. Not every court
  can give you every kind of help. For example, you can only
  ask for visitation in the Probate and Family Court. Only
  the Housing Court or Superior Court can hear discrimination
  cases.
  
  Depending on where you live, different courts may be further or closer to
  your address. There are many district courts all over the state,
  but each county has only one or a few Superior Courts or specialty
  courts.
  
  Choosing a court means thinking about what kind of help you need, as well
  as which court you can get transportation to on the day of your hearing.
  
  Only you know the right choice.
  
  % else:
  If you are responding to a case someone else filed, you may not
  get to choose your court. Select the court that is already
  listed on your court paperwork.
